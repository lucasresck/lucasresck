### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc student in Mathematical Modeling with a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics, both at [FGV-EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/en).

Currently, I do research in the [Visual Data Science Lab research group](https://github.com/visual-ds). My main contribution occurs in the areas of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence.

This GitHub account stores and versions codes for projects, research, assignments, exercises, and classes.
