### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Applied Mathematics undergraduate student who codes.

Currently, I do research in the [Visual Data Science Lab research group](https://github.com/visual-ds). My main contribution occurs in the areas of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Natural Language Processing.

This GitHub stores and versions codes for projects, assignments, exercises, and classes.
